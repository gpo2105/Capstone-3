Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\\nDiana: Thank you. What's your current budget?\\nTom: We were thinking about £400 000. Would it be possible?\\nDiana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?\\nTom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.\\nDiana: How much are you aiming for?\\nTom: At least £300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.\\nDiana: Could you please send me some pictures?

Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.\\nQuentin: I don\\'t know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.\\nTarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing? \\nQuentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm\\nTarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up. \\nQuentin: Great.\\nTarquin: How many books do you think there will be?\\nQuentin: About 200, like the other time.\\nTarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? \\nQuentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \\nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\\nTarquin: But it\\'s really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\\nQuentin: Yes, that\\'s probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\\nTarquin: Yes. That\\'s from Peter\\'s company right?\\nQuentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing. I\\'ll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise.',\n",

I just the clock and I really wasn’t late. Aren’t they supposed to wait at least 5-10 minutes?\\nFrank: Yes, they are, I think they should at least call you before driving away\\nAnna: Exactly! No one called me, I still have time, but he ended the trip before I managed to come down. I live on the first floor for god’s sake\\nArthur: Were you charged for it?\\nAnna: Yeah, the whole sum!\\nFrank: What?! If he cancelled, you should have paid only a cancellation fee\\nAnna: That’s why I said it was weird. I think I was simply scammed.\\nArthur: Hm, it does seem like that. Have you notified Uber about it? You can send a complaint\\nAnna: Not yet, but I think I will. It seems to me that he accepted the trip and ended it short afterwards, I’m just not sure, don’t want to accuse anyway\\nFrank: But it sure looks like a scam, that way he can get the whole sum, because it looks like he just finished his ride.\\nAnna: Sending a complaint right now.\\nFrank: You can do it in the app, uber tracks all your journeys.\\nArthur: I don’t get why people do something like that\\nFrank: I hope the guy gets kicked out\\nAnna: Maybe he didn’t do it on purpose… I don’t know\\nArthur: I think you should report him anyway, I highly doubt you can do something like that by accident',\n",
