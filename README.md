# Capstone 3
Final Flatiron AI Project
Instructions: Copied/Pasted from coursework dashboard.
Deliverables:
1) Word Docs/PDFs: Initial Proposal, Review of Project/Lessons Learned
2) Images:  Includes proposal diagram, summary statistics for the dataset and analysis of the generated summaries (Model 3) 
3) HTML Pages: Saved out copies of notebook at different stages of code being executed.  Including two versions ("Barebones") after a model had been succesfully trained.  One copy ("Scored") to capture notebook after conducting some analysis on Model 3's generated summaries.
4) Draft Notebook
5) Final Clean Notebook
6) Results from Training
Research
Models (Even Compressed; file too large for GitHub  Desktop): 4 Models in Pytorch formats with their weights; Models 1 & 2 are experimental; Model 3 was trained with most of the dataset (75%); Model 4 was trained with only 20% of the dataset but with the larger pre-trained FB model; also Batch size was 15 vs 5 for the other models.
